# The Best Pok√©mon Card Discord Bot

*Gimme Cards* is Discord chat bot that lets you collect virtual Pok√©mon cards on-the-go. You can choose from over ***100*** different packs to open, featuring additional cards from legacy, promo, and special expansions.

<br>

## üîß My Technical Work

I built this using Java and the [Java Discord API (JDA)](https://jda.wiki/introduction/jda/), with Maven for dependency management. It supports inventory tracking, rate limiting (for command cooldowns), and uses event-driven, modular command handlers.

User data is encrypted and stored in JSON files, then loaded into memory and cached in lists on startup. I implemented custom mergesort and binary search functions to efficiently manage user sessions and improve scalability.

<br>

## ‚ùì How to Use:

1. Invite Gimme Cards to your Discord server by using the [following URL](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=814025499381727232&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

2. In your Discord server, type the `/help` command to get started. It'll point you to some important resources.
